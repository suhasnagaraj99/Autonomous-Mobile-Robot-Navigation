# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot-Navigation
ENPM809Y Final Project - Navigate autonomously using SLAM and action-client nodes in ROS2. The waypoints are determined by reading the positions of batteries placed in the environment through cameras. The TF tree is consulted to obtain the current position of the robot and the waypoint locations.
